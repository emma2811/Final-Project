# Final-Project

Author: Emmanuel Amekudzi.

### My end of term project for 454

### Project Goal: 
Explore the significance of magnetic characteristics in geological and environmental contexts by developing an overview of the geophysical inversion of magnetic susceptibility data. Through exploring the fundamentals, strategies, and uses of inversion technique, we may unlock the abundance of data hidden beneath the surface of the Earth and advance our knowledge of the dynamic processes sculpting it.

### Project Objectives

The main objective of this process is to:
1.	Estimating a model for predicting data
2.	outline a suitable misfit by comparing data from the field survey to the predicted data.
3.	Produce an optimal model by constraining the infinite number of solutions to information that are already known.

### Software Installation
