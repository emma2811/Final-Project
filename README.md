## My end of term project for 454
Project Goal: Explore the significance of magnetic characteristics in geological and environmental contexts by developing an overview of the geophysical inversion of magnetic susceptibility data. Through exploring the fundamentals, strategies, and uses of inversion technique, we may unlock the abundance of data hidden beneath the surface of the Earth and advance our knowledge of the dynamic processes sculpting it.
